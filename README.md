# Pomodoro Project

Welcome,

This project is the result of an assignement I was given at @BeCode.
The purpose was to create a React website with the help of Parcel.

The website was to offer a timer following the pomodoro technique (25 minutes of work / 5 minutes of break).

I made full use of the useState hook as well as a little of the useEffect hook.

## Tech

-   React (hooks)
-   Parcel
-   Scss

## How to use

You can find the deployed version [HERE](https://pomodorojc.netlify.app/). Just open up the website on your favorite device and hit play ! The counter will go down until it reaches zero.

At which point the app will offer you to either stop or to take a break.

If you chose de latter, the counter will automatically start counting down from 5 minutes.

You have the option to tweak the time to your liking and there is also a reset button in case you messed things up.

### Thank you for reading.
